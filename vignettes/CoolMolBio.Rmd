## Overview

The aim of this simple R package is to replicate the central dogma of molecular biology. The package provides a collection of functions that help visualise and summarise nucleotide data and perform basic functions on DNA sequences, like transcription, translation, plotting, etc.

## Installation

Load the library:

```{r setup}
library("CoolMolBio")
```

## Functions

The package has 5 different functions explained in the following:

### 1. dnaSequence()

This function generates a random DNA sequence of a specified length. It samples nucleotides ("A", "T", "G", "C") with replacement, meaning bases can repeat, and then concatenates them into a single string.

```{r}
dnaSequence(21)
```

### 2. transcription()

This function receives a DNA strand as a string and converts all T's into U's, turning it into an RNA strand.

```{r}
transcription("ATCGCTAG")
```

### 3. extractCodon()

This function extracts codons from a DNA coding sequence. You can specify the starting nucleotide to shift the reading frame (default is 1). If the sequence length is not a multiple of 3, it extracts as many full codons as possible.

Extract codons from default coding frame:

```{r}
extractCodon("ATCGTC")
```

Extract codons starting from the second nucleotide:

```{r}
extractCodon("TATCGTC", 2)
```

### 4. translation()

The translation function converts mRNA codons into their a peptide sequence.

```{r}
translation(c("AUG", "GUC", "AUC"))
```

### 5. createHistogram()

This function generates a histogram that shows how often each nucleotide appears in a given DNA sequence. The output is a histogram where each bar represents one nucleotide.

```{r}
createHistogram("ATGCGTTA")
```

## Use Cases and Future Extensions

-   **Teaching tool**: Ideal for classroom use to demonstrate DNA sequence analysis concepts.
-   **Quick sequence inspection**: Useful for researchers needing fast insights without complex bioinformatics tools.
-   **Data validation**: Helps verify sequence quality before downstream analyses like alignment or motif detection.

## Potential Future Functions

-   **`reverseComplement(dna_seq)`**: Get the reverse complement of DNA.
-   **`exportResults(summary, file = "results.csv")`**: Write counts/histograms to CSV/PNG for downstream use.
-   **`codonUsage()`**: Analyse codon frequency bias.

## Main points from Task 3 (summary)

-   The package’s goal is to simplify basic DNA → RNA → protein operations and visualisations for learners and prototypers.
-   It emphasises ease of use and interpretability: small functions, clear inputs/outputs, and simple visual outputs.

**Limiting dependencies:**

-   Fewer dependencies make our package more stable, faster to install, and easier to maintain. Each extra dependency adds potential for version conflicts or breakages.

@importFrom **vs. `package::function()`**

-   @importFrom package function imports a function so it can be used directly without the `::` prefix\
    It is useful for frequent use but less explicit.
-   `package::function()` calls the function directly from another package without importing\
    It is clearer and safer for occasional use.
